# Analysis of Los Angeles Crime Data
### Devon Gorel

## Introduction

The analysis  completed here dove into crime within Los Angeles in the past 4 years, seeking to find underlying trends. It uncovred a plethora of interesting things, namely that the COVID 19 Pandemic seemed to have an impact on the crime rate, along with the fact that different types of crimes occured in different proportions based on the area of Los Angeles. These discoveries, as well as others, are supported through graphs displayed on this website. Not all of the questions set out to be answered were easily discovered, yet many interesting takeaways were yeilded from the analysis.

## Dataset

The data set analyzed within this website contains data on crimes committed within Los Angeles from the year 2020 until now. 
It was collected by the Police Department of the City of Los Angeles, and contains thorough entries on each crime, including the date, type of crime, victim demographic, weapons used, and the location.
I was interested in the data because I thought it could provide a small yet thorough examination of crime over the past four years, and examine trends regarding it. For example, what crimes
occurred the most, if certain locations were more common for certain crimes, and if there was a trend on when crimes tended to occur. The data can be found here: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present


## Initial Questions

The draw of this data to me initially was that it was a rather robust dataset on crime encompassing many years, as well as many types of crimes, with data even down to the weapons and victims used. I was curious about many things going into this data, with some of the main questions I had being:
- Were certain areas of the city worse for crime?
- Was the crime rate constant over time?
- Did most crimes use weapons?
- Did the pandemic see a fall in physical based crimes? 

As I worked with the data, I came up with several more questions, partly because of the answers to my initial questions, and some due to difficulty handling the data. For example,
the crime categories were rather difficult to seperate into strictly physical and non physical crimes, so I ended up scrapping that question. Yet as I saw the trend in crime rate over time, I generalized the question on physical crimes to see if the pandemic seemed to affect crime rate at all. I also found that the data contained many null entries concerning weapon data, so I restructured my question to see which weapons were most common when used. Other questions I came up with included:
- Were the types of crimes proportionally distributed throughout parts of the city?
- How long did theft crimes typically take to be reported?
- Were victim demographics proportionate throughout the different areas?

The data was fairly easy to work with, as it was very well structured. The largest challenge I encountered was simply having to filter out empty or null data when examining certain fields, yet this was fairly simple. I was fairly surprised by the takeaways of some of the charts I constructed, such as the weapon chart and average reporting time chart.
